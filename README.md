# Weather Prediction Analysis
## WeatherTech Inc. Rainfall Prediction Project

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict rainfall based on various weather features including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop an accurate rainfall prediction model that can help forecast precipitation events based on meteorological data. This tool aims to provide valuable insights for weather forecasting and planning.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering pipeline
- Multiple classification algorithms implementation
- Model performance evaluation and visualization
- Comprehensive analysis of weather patterns

## Technical Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- xgboost (optional)
  
## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values
- Convert categorical variables
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Data validation and cleaning

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Create derived weather features
- Handle temporal patterns
- Feature selection and importance analysis
- Data transformation and encoding

### 3. Model Development
- Implementation of multiple classifiers

- Confusion Matrix

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/weathertech/weather-prediction.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the notebooks in order:
   - Start with data exploration
   - Proceed to feature engineering
   - Finally, train and evaluate models

## Results

The model performance metrics and visualizations will be updated here after initial training and evaluation.
